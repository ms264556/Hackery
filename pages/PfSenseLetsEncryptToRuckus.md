# Push TLS Certificates to Ruckus ZoneDirector / Unleashed

There's no official API for pushing certificates to Ruckus ZoneDirector or Ruckus Unleashed.  
This is a pain. Free TLS certificates issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) are only good for 90 days, so automation is key.

You can use the shell script, below, to push certificates to Ruckus Unleashed or ZoneDirector.  
The script has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu) & FreeBSD (pfSense).

The script takes 3 arguments:  
  1) The path to your certificate/fullchain file.  
    (for ACME, this is the _cert_name_.crt file, or the _cert_name_.fullchain file).
  
  2) The path to your private key file.  
    (for ACME, this is the _cert_name_.key file).
  
  3) The FQDN of your ZoneDirector or Unleashed Master AP.  
   This is very important, espcially if you use a wildcard certificate: when you visit your ZoneDirector/Unleashed web UI you will be redirected to `https://FQDN/`
  
> You need to edit the script to replace `ZD_USERNAME` and `ZD_PASSWORD` with your own ZoneDirector/Unleashed admin username and password.

> The script expects to be able to find your ZoneDirector/Unleashed at the specified fully qualified domain name. So make sure you have already setup split DNS, if necessary.

```sh
ZD_USERNAME='myruckususername'
ZD_PASSWORD='myruckuspassword'

ZD_CERTIFICATE=$1
ZD_KEY=$2
ZD_FQDN=$3

ZD_COOKIE=$(mktemp)

ZD_LOGIN_URL="$(curl https://$ZD_FQDN -k -s -L -I -o /dev/null -w '%{url_effective}')"
LOGIN_ARGS="-k -c $ZD_COOKIE"
ZD_XSS="$(curl $LOGIN_ARGS $ZD_LOGIN_URL -d username=$ZD_USERNAME -d password=$ZD_PASSWORD -d ok=Log\ In -i | awk '/^HTTP_X_CSRF_TOKEN:/ { print $2 }' | tr -d '\040\011\012\015')"

ZD_BASE_URL="$(dirname $ZD_LOGIN_URL)"
CONF_ARGS="-i -k -b $ZD_COOKIE -c $ZD_COOKIE"
ZD_UPLOAD="$CONF_ARGS $ZD_BASE_URL/_upload.jsp?request_type=xhr"
ZD_CMD="$CONF_ARGS $ZD_BASE_URL/_cmdstat.jsp"

rm $ZD_COOKIE
```

## Example: Automatically push Let's Encrypt Certificate from pfSense to Unleashed or ZoneDirector

If you've got the Acme service setup in pfSense then you can push Let's Encrypt certificates onto your ZoneDirector/Unleashed whenever they come in.
This will reboot the target ZoneDirector/Unleashed, but the Acme service runs at 3:16am so probably no big issue.
> Be aware that older Unleashed APs (e.g. R500 or R600) may take 10 minutes to reboot completely.

### Create the Script

* Use `Diagnostics` / `Edit File` to create a new file `/usr/local/bin/export_zd_cert.sh`, containing the above script.

### Make the Script Executable

* Use `Diagnostics` / `Command Prompt` to execute `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/export_zd_cert.sh`.

### Ask the Acme Service to run the script after renewing your certificate

* In `Services` / `Acme Certificates` / `General settings`, make sure the `Write Certificates` box is ticked.

* In `Services` / `Acme Certificates` / `Certificates`, edit the certificate you want to use on your Ruckus ZoneDirector/Unleashed.  

* Add a `Shell Command` to the `Actions List`:  
    `/usr/local/bin/export_zd_cert.sh /conf/acme/name.of.this.certificate.fullchain /conf/acme/name.of.this.certificate.key zdhost.your.domain.name` .  
    
  > `zdhost.your.domain.name` is whatever fully qualified hostname you're using for your ZoneDirector/Unleashed, and `name.of.this.certificate` is what you entered in the `Name` box for this certificate.

* Ensure that the `Private Key` setting for your certificate is RSA (ECDSA TLS certificates are unsupported on Unleashed and ZoneDirector).  

### (Optionally) Add a DNS Host Override

The script expects to be able to find your ZoneDirector/Unleashed at the specified fully qualified domain name.

If your `Domain` in `System` / `General Setup` is different from the the domain in your certificate (e.g. your certitificate is for `*.your.domain.name` but your pfSense domain is `localdomain`), then you might need pfSense to return an internal IP for `zdhost.your.domain.name`.
* Go to `Services` / `DNS Resolver`, and `Add` a `Host Override`.
